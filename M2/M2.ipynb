    "\n",
    "First, we introduce [Markdown][md], which is an annotated format for writing text that can be rendered easily in different manners. You will use Markdown throughout the course, as it is enables writing documents quickly by forcing the writer to concentrate on the content over presentation.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to write Markdown to indicate:\n",

    "- header text,\n",
    "- inline styling,\n",
    "- lists,\n",
    "- code,\n",
    "- math formula, and\n",
    "- quoting text.\n",
