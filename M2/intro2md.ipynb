    "[Markdown][1] is a plain text formatting syntax that you can easily use to write text that can be converted to formatted text, for example, HTML. Markdown was developed by John Gruber, who runs the popular [Daring Fireball][df] blog. Markdown has found many uses, two of which are relevant for this course:\n",
    "1. github documentation pages, and\n",
    "2. IPython Notebook documentation cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is [free software][2] that is available under a BSD-style open source license. The Jupyter organization has [documentation][3] that demonstrates how to use Markdown within a cell to produce formatted text, and of course we often use documentation presented in Jupyter Notebooks that use Markdown cells.\n",

    "## Lists\n",

    "You can easily create two types of lists in Markdown: unordered and ordered, both of which can be nested. To make a simple unordered list, we simply prefix the list entries (that is a line) by a single asterisk `*`, dash `-`, or plus `+` character. To create a nested list, you indent the nested list by one or more spaces. For consistency, I prefer to use the dash `-` character to indicate unordered lists. For example, the following Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Item 1\n",
    "- Item 2\n",
    " - Item 2.1\n",
    " - Item 2.2\n",
    "- Item 3\n",

    "- Item 2\n",
    " - Item 2.1\n",
    " - Item 2.2\n",
    "- Item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered lists are similar, but are prefixed by numbers and a period, for example `1.` for the first item. The Markdown numbers used to indicate list items do not have to start at one. As an example, the text generated from the following Markdown will be formatted to begin at two and proceed sequentially.\n",

    "## Representing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful features of Markdown is the ability to include formatted code directly in the text. Code elements can be included in two manners: inline and block. Inline code elements are simply wrapped in single starting quote \\` characters (also called a backtick or more formally grave accent). For example, the Markdown \\`print(\"Hello World!\")\\` renders as `print(\"Hello World!\")`. Code blocks can also be placed on a single line with no quote characters by indenting the line four characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For longer code blocks, you can enclose the block in three backtick/single quote characters \\`\\`\\`. For example, the following code block in Markdown:   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\`\\`\\`\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 3  \n",
    "y = 4  \n",

    "\\`\\`\\`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "will produce the following code block:  \n",

    "  \n",
    "print(\"%b\" % (x**2 + y**2 = z**2) \n",
    "```   \n",

    "You also can use what is known as Github flavored Markdown to indicate the target program language by adding the language name after the initial three single quote characters.

For example, applying this to the previous example produces the syntax-highlighted version:\n",

    "## Math Formulae\n",
    "\n",
    "We can include detailed math formulae in a markdown cell by using [LaTeX][1], a general purpose text formatting language that is commonly used in academia for scientific articles. LaTeX can be difficult to master but is fairly simple for writing simple math formulae. The LaTeX formulae are translated for display in a web browser by the [MathJax][2] Javascript display engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "To indicate a LaTeX formula, the simplest approach is to enclose the relevant LaTeX between dollar sign characters, `$ ... $` or to make the expression appear on its own line you enclose the expression between double dollar sign characters, `$$ ... $$`. Many specific functions or math symbols are prefixed with a backslash character, `\\`. For example, to write the LaTeX formula for lowercase Greek character theta, you would write `$\\theta$`. The [support for mathematical expressions][3] in LaTeX is quite extensive, and there are tools, such as [LaTeXit][4] or browser add-ons that can help build and test LaTeX expressions.\n",
