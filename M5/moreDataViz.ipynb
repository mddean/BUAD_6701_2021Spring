    "In our previous notebook we saw how to use data visualizations to help us understand distribution analysis of a single variable. In this notebook we move on to looking for relationships between two or more variables within a dataset. In the context of predictive modeling (i.e., forecasting or machine learning), we want to understand how various variables relate to the \"output\" variable -- the one we are trying to predict. One visual approach is to create a **scatter plot** of two variables. In a scatter plot, you want the variable you are trying to predict to **always** be the $y$-variable because you have some \"belief\" that the other varialbe, the $x$-variable is affecting the outcome variable. As you $x$ changes, how does $y$ react?"

    "The statement below causes the `matplotlib` graphs to appear within the Jupyter Notebook explicitly rather than in a separate window that pops up. This can be very convenient because, among other reasons, the image will be retained in the notebook and computation will not be paused when many graphs are constructed within a loop. Statements that start with `%` are called magic functions. The `%` indicates a system command so that it is executed properly. In newer versions of Jupyter Notebook, you often do **not** need to call it. If you use an IDE, then you will have to use call `plt.show()` to explicitly show your graph. In Juptyer Notebook, you do not need to use that call."
