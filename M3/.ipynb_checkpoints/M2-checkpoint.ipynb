    "# Module 2: Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This module focuses on the basic features in the Python programming language that underlie most data analytics programs (or scripts). We have already learned the basic concepts of the Python programming language such as how to create variables, basic data types and mathematical operators, and how to document your programs with comments. Now, we turn our attention to other built-in data types and data structures in Python. Then, we will learn about Boolean and logical operators in Python and how they can be used to control the flow of a Python program by using conditional statements. We will also explore two different types of loops to control the flow of our programs. Then, we will learn about functions and how they can simplify developing and maintaining computer programs. We will also learn how to create and call functions in Python. \n",
