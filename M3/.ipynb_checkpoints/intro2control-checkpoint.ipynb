Thus, if the first part of an `and` operation is `False` (or, conversely `True` for an `or` operation), the remaining part of the statement will not be processed since the overall result will be `False`. This approach is known as _short-circuiting_ and can produce faster code execution; however, it can easily lead to confusion if you perform function calls or variable creation in the latter parts of a conditional statement.\n",
