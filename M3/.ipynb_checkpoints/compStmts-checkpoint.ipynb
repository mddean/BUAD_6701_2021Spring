    "## List Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are convenient ways to quickly create a `list`. We'll look at a \"traditional\" way to create a `list` using a `for` loop and then create the same `list` using list comprehension. To create a list comprehension, you need to understand that every list comprehension includes three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `expression` is the member itself, a call to a method, or any other valid expression that returns a value.\n",
    "2. `member` is the object or value in the list or iterable.\n",
    "3. `iterable` is a list, set, sequence, generator, or any other object that can return its elements one at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The format to create a new `list` using a comprehension statement then is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "newList = [expression for member in iterable]\n",
    "```"
   ]

    "One of the advantages of using a list comprehension statement is that you can often gain efficiency and speed up your code. For many of the tasks that we will encounter, this may not be a huge deal. However, when you start to create larger and more involved Python programs, you may find the gain in speed is worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the disadvantages of a list comprehension statement is that it is more difficult to read and understand for Python beginners. If you come from another programming language, like Java, then it is also new to you. Many people argue that once you understand the format it is easier to read and understand and is in fact a more **Pythonic** way to write code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional thing to keep in mind is that every list comprehension statement can always be translated to a traditional `for` loop. The reverse is **not** true; not every `for` loop can be converted to a comprehension statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try an example. We'll create a list that contains the squares of the numbers 1 through 1000. "

One of the benefits of a list comprehension statement, once you get used to using them, is that it focuses on *what* you want to put in the list. In our case, we wanted to put the squared values in the new list. This expression is the first part of the comprehension statement, emphasizing *what* we are storing in the new list. If you have a strong mathematics background, you might think of of this as describing sets or perhaps equations."
