    "The Python language provides convenience functions and supports the creation and application of user-defined functions, which can simplify program development by promoting code reuse. In this notebook, we introduce a number of built-in functions such as the `print` function. For now, we use this function to simply display messages and unformatted variables. However, this function in general is very useful and can easily display formatted output. Over future notebooks, we will introduce additional functionality for this (and other similar functions) that will include instructions on how to display properly formatted data.\n",

However, if we separate multiple values with a comma (or place them all inside parentheses where the values are separated by commas), we can return multiple values. Formally, this uses a data structure called a `tuple`, which we introduced early. \n",
